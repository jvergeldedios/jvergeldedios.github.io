Almost any service that you sign up for will require you to sign up using your email address and, at some point, prove you have control of that email address by verifying some secret that they email you (or via OAuth). This is an anti-pattern, but one that was necessary because the internet and the world wide web were built without an identity and authentication layer prescribed via RFC or standard. Implementers were left to their own devices and did the best they could with the tools that were available to them.</p> <p>This is one of the core issues that Decentralized Identifiers (otherwise known as DIDs) attempt to address, and it’s a subtle one that often doesn’t get very well explained in the foundational literature of Self-Sovereign Identity.</p> <h2 id="why-are-email-addresses-poor-identifiers">Why are email addresses poor identifiers?</h2> <p>Email addresses are identifiers within the SMTP protocol. They are now quite ubiquitous with a very familiar <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user@example.com</code> format where the segment preceding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@</code> symbol is the username and the segment following the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@</code> symbol is the host or domain where the user resides. Unsurprisingly, given the name “email,” it was designed primarily as a messaging protocol and these addresses mapped to “mailboxes.”</p> <p>The SMTP protocol makes no prescriptions for verifying the authenticity of a sender, how to authenticate a user when they’re logging in to check their email, or any other authentication mechanisms whatsoever. It is purely a messaging protocol and transport specification. But they are identifiers of <em>some</em> kind and provide the developers of web services with <em>something</em> relatively unique that they can tie to a user and establish accounts. The conflation of the original intended purpose of email addresses as message routing identifiers with authentication identifiers is where the problem arises.</p> <p>One problem is that email addresses are more ephemeral than we’d like to think. There are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/22/google-csam-account-blocked">countless</a> <a href="https://x.com/miguelytob/status/1315749803041619981">stories</a> of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210209003605/https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/1358661840402845696">people</a> who lose access to their email address either because they were banned from one of the major providers (e.g. Google, Yahoo), or they graduated from university and any accounts tied to their university-provided address are no longer accessible, or they simply forgot their password and don’t have a way to recover it. Even owning your own domain and maintaining your own email address can’t fully solve this problem. There are plenty of stories of domains getting sniped when they expire, or people <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/millions-at-risk-due-to-google-s-oauth-flaw">maliciously buying domains of defunct companies to get access to their accounts</a>. And when that happens your whole online persona goes with it.</p> <p>Several problems arise specifically from the conflation of the communication channel with the authentication channel. Because authentication mechanisms via email identifier are largely undefined by any spec, implementers are left to figure things out on their own. This has led to a number of mechanisms with varying issues. Passwords are still pervasive in 2025 despite the recent introduction of passkeys. Passwords have a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-user-passwords-in-plain-text-for-years/">number</a> of <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/">well documented issues</a>.</p> <p>“Magic link” is a particularly popular mechanism for logging people in via email. The flow is relatively simple. You prove your ownership of an email address by receiving a link that only you and the service you’re logging into should have. You click the link, and it re-routes you to the service that you’re logging into.</p> <p>One issue is primarily a UX one: the deliverability of the authentication email requires the user to be online and for all of the email plumbing to work flawlessly. Email deliverability is a dark art similar to SEO thanks to Google’s blackbox spam filtering, so unless you’re already on a high-authority domain that Google allows fast delivery for, or you pay a provider that has such infrastructure in place, you may be out-of-luck as an independent provider.</p> <p>Phishing is another issue. One of the only reasons that phishing is even a viable attack is because of the conflation between authentication and communication. When a “reset password” email or magic link hits your inbox, you’re receiving both a communication and a request to authenticate. This dual-channel is exactly the vulnerability that phishing exploits.</p> <h2 id="are-there-any-alternatives">Are there any alternatives?</h2> <p>To reiterate the problems we are trying to address, we need an identifier that:</p> <ol> <li>Is globally unique</li> <li>Is distinct from a communication identifier</li> <li>Is decoupled from its authentication mechanism</li> <li>Is fully in the control of the owner of the identifier</li> </ol> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/emails-are-terrible/did-example-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/emails-are-terrible/did-example-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/emails-are-terrible/did-example-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/emails-are-terrible/did-example.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 bg-white" width="100%" height="auto" alt="An example of a Decentralized Identifier with brackets labeling the scheme, DID method, and identifier" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> An example DID </div> <p>One solution that checks all of those boxes is Decentralized Identifiers or DIDs. You can read the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">spec</a> for yourself for a complete overview, but basically they:</p> <ol> <li>Prescribe a format for a globally unique identifier string</li> <li>Resolve to a document that is controlled by the owner that contains details such as preferred authentication mechanisms</li> <li>Allow multiple implementations to be identified via “methods” that prescribe how to perform actions such as creating, resolving, updating, or deleting a DID and its document</li> <li>Is completely independent of any other purpose besides itself being an identifier</li> </ol> <p>There are also multiple specs being developed for end-user flows that allow for using a DID for things such as logging into websites, or receiving and presenting verifiable data in the form of Verifiable Credentials (VCs, the subject of a future post).</p> <p>There are several implementations of DID methods that employ different mechanisms for storage and resolution of DID documents. Some are very simple and do 1:1 mapping of an identity to a single cryptographic key (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">did:key</code></a>), some rely on DNS (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">did:web</code></a>), and some rely on some form of decentralized storage such as a blockchain (<a href="https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">did:ethr</code></a>). Each method has tradeoffs for usability and security. Obviously the DNS based methods have similar drawbacks to email domains.</p> <p>While I do believe that ultimately a blockchain is one of the best approaches to guarantee resolution availability and security of writes to the DID document, the ecosystem does sometimes suffer from the usual crypto nonsense.</p> <h2 id="where-do-we-go-from-here">Where do we go from here?</h2> <p>I’m not even making the argument that DIDs are the ultimate solution for this problem. They haven’t been deployed widely enough or have seen enough real-world usage to make any such proclamation. Most development has been entirely theoretical at the spec level with very few live deployments. I am however making the argment that the status-quo is untenable and will continue to cause harm to end users and service providers. DIDs provide an alternative that at least try to address some of these fundamental issues and provide us with a testing ground to play with these ideas meaningfully.

Whether it was stories of him dancing the night away at the famous club that was the epicenter of Manila’s 70s disco culture known as Cocobanana. Or donning a helmet and carving his way through the snarled gridlock of Manila’s roadways on his Honda Scrambler motorcycle. Or his Tom Selleck of Manila mustache. They all idolized him for his ability to exude this maverick persona.</p> <p>Part of that devil-may-care air-of-cool was always having a cigarette in hand. From what I remember by the early 90s, about the time he was going to turn 40, he had been a pack-a-day guy for almost 20 years. The 90s is also when big tobacco was finally coming clean about what cigarettes could do to you and how much damage they could do to not just you, but the people around you inhaling your secondhand smoke.</p> <p>By this time, I had also already started showing signs of childhood asthma. It was clear to Papa that the cigarettes had to go. But, knowing that kicking the habit would be a high-effort endeavor, he figured out that he could use the occasion to extract a little more value out of his son. He decided he would make me a deal: you get straight As on your next report card and I’ll quit smoking. A heavy burden to put on a 1st grader.</p> <p>It was the beginning of the school year and it would be six weeks before my next report card. I desperately wanted Papa to be healthier and I knew that the cigarettes weren’t good for my breathing either, so I worked diligently for that 6 weeks and got my straight As. The day after I presented him with my report card he quit cold turkey.</p> <p>His methods may have been questionable, but I can’t argue that they weren’t effective.</p> <p>The lesson I learned from Papa that day: people will run through brick walls for you if you figure out what motivates them.</p>]]></content><author><name>flyingburrito</name></author><category term="papa"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is part of a series memorializing my dad, Rolando Vergel de Dios, who passed away unexpectedly on November 29th, 2024.

It checks a lot of the boxes above by default, with others being supported by plugins. I followed the quickstart and in short order had a basic Jekyll dev instance set up with the default Minima theme.</p> <p>While an excellently flexible tool, the base install leaves a lot to be desired. Minima isn’t <em>bad</em> but it left a lot of things for me to do myself and I wanted a little bit more of a full package included. I started searching for themes that would fulfill what I wanted while being minimalist and content focused. That’s when I found <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a>. It definitely benefitted from the phonebook effect of showing up first in an alphabetical list, but it had pretty much the rest of the list that I wanted and a few other bonuses. Weird quirk: it’s designed for academics to share their CV, projects, and publications, which I don’t currently need, but could come in handy in the future I guess.</p> <p>I did run into a few issues getting the Github Actions to run without errors as well as having to dig into issues and other places to get some customizations that I wanted, so I’m documenting what I found here to hopefully save other people time.</p> <h1 id="github-actions-errors">Github Actions errors</h1> <p>I kept getting broken link errors when building my pages which didn’t prevent the site from deploying but were annoyingly sending failure emails with every push.

Many of his friends and family know him as Rolando, Roly, or <a href="https://jonsquared.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/filipino-sibling-hierarchy/">Diko</a>, but my brother Gabriel and I know him as Papa. To say this has upended my life and the lives of everyone in my family would be an understatement. It’s been 3 weeks and I still have the disorienting feeling that none of this is real and that I will wake from the nightmare soon. Sadly that day isn’t coming, so I’m left to try and make sense of something that will never make sense to me. That my father is gone and that I’ll never again be able to speak with him or ask him for advice. I’ll never again be able to call him to share my good news or my sorrows. It’s cliché but I truly didn’t understand how large a loss this would be until it happened, despite spending a good deal of time worrying about it for both of my parents.</p> <p>I decided to search his name on Google after he passed and was kind of sad to find that there really isn’t much of a digital footprint for him out there. The only thing is <a href="https://www.holycrossmortuary.com/obituary/rolando-vergel-de-dios">the generic obituary page</a> that the mortuary created for us automatically with nothing other than his photo and dates of birth and death. In my life and in my family he is a larger than life presence. A booming voice, thunderous laughter, and always the life of the party wherever he goes. Part of this exercise is me grieving, but I also feel strongly that such a presence should have a place here, some marker of his existence.</p> <p>As a Filipino family, we did the traditional 9 night novena prayer for him over Zoom, with family and friends signing in from all over the world. Each night a different group of people offered a eulogy with memories of times that they shared with him. It was amazing to hear how many lives he’d touched. I was the last to do mine on night 9, and I’m sharing an expanded version of that here. This will be a series of posts that offer up a different lesson that I learned from him depicted as little vignettes from my life growing up as his son.</p> <p>I love you, Papa. I miss you, and I will every day for the rest of my life.</p> <p>Hold your loved ones close, you really never know when they’re going to go.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/lessons-from-papa/papa-julian-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/lessons-from-papa/papa-julian-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/lessons-from-papa/papa-julian-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/lessons-from-papa/papa-julian.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Me and Papa at the South Bay Galleria c. 1988.

I still live in the same neighborhood to this day. It’s basically the ideal of post-WW2 United States. Cute minimal traditional style homes with manicured lawns on comfortably large lots with big back yards. They once upon a time housed factory workers for the booming LA aerospace industry.</p> <p>I took full advantage of the big back yard. One glorious Christmas morning I awoke to a very large wrapped present in that very yard. After tearing it open what I found was a PowerWheels Army Jeep. If you don’t know what that is, it’s a child-sized, plastic, battery-powered, motorized replica of a WW2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willys_MB">Willys Jeep</a>. It was slow but man was it badass. I would imagine missions to clear mines out from behind the garage, slowly making my way into enemy territory. If Gabriel and I were getting along I would let him ride shotgun, or if I was really in a generous mood he would get to drive it. I loved that thing.</p> <p>I went to a preschool nearby the house, close enough to walk or bike, although given that this is Los Angeles my parents still drove to pick me up and drop me off. Papa was who was usually charged with that duty.</p> <p>I’ll never forget this one time at the end of the school day. Just as we were about to let out, something unusual was brewing outside. Papa and my French grandfather, Papy (who was visiting from across the Atlantic), had hatched a delightfully mischievous plan. They’d quietly maneuvered the Jeep into position on the sidewalk next to the gate alongside the regular line of minivans and sedans in the pickup lane.</p> <p>As I shuffled out with my classmates, tummy rumbling for an afternoon snack, I spotted them first – two grown men wearing matching conspiratorial grins, standing proudly beside the tan and camo colored Jeep. My heart leapt. Whatever was happening, I knew it would be good.</p> <p>I waved goodbye hurriedly to my friends, already breaking into a run. Their confused expressions turned to pure amazement as I scrambled behind the wheel. With Papa’s encouraging nod and Papy’s twinkling eyes watching, I slammed my foot on the accelerator. The look on my classmates’ faces was priceless – a mix of disbelief and envy as I, a mere preschooler, drove myself home that day. I felt like the star of my own movie, rolling away from school in perhaps the most spectacular exit of my young life.</p> <p>The lesson I learned from Papa that day: you can find fun in even the most mundane everyday activities.</p>]]></content><author><name>flyingburrito</name></author><category term="papa"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been thinking of starting my blog for years at this point, but I never thought something like this would be the final push or the topic of my first post.]]></summary></entry></feed>
