Hi, I'm Julian Vergel de Dios.

Why Flying Burrito?

I sold cars at a car dealership briefly in my college days with my cousin Marc. Our sales manager, Andy, would greet us with a hearty "Hey, it's the Flying Burrito Brothers!" whenever he'd see us together. Never knew why other than it being a reference to [the 70s band of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flying_Burrito_Brothers).

I've since become a very okay-ish software engineer and technology entrepreneur. I've co-founded two companies you've probably never heard of: PocketList and Heirloom with my business partner [Nick Daz√©](https://nickdaze.com).

This space is just for me to write and express myself, whether for personal purposes or professional. I hope you find it interesting or at least a little entertaining. Or not, I'm not your boss.
